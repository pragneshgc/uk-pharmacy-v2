subject : [ReferenceNumber] has name discrepancy ($country_name)

Dear <TML NAME=CLI-NAME>,

The responsible pharmacist is unable to process the order number <TML NAME=PRS-REFERENCENUMBER> as there is a potential discrepancy in the name.
Please see the pharmacistâ€™s comments here:

Please amend the order based on the comments highlighted by the pharmacist.
                                                
This order will be cancelled and you will have to re-send another order.

Kind Regards
