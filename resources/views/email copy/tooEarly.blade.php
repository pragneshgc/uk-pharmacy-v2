subject : [ReferenceNumber] has ordered too early ($country_name)

Dear <TML NAME=CLI-NAME>,

The responsible pharmacist has declined order number <TML NAME=PRS-REFERENCENUMBER> because they
deem that the patient has ordered too early.

Please see the Pharmacist comments here:

<b><i><u><TML NAME=MESSAGE></u></i></b>

The order will be cancelled and you will not be billed for this. If you are able to
edit the order then please do so and simply send a new order to process.

Kind Regards

HR Healthcare Dispensing Team.
